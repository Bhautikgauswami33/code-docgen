# Documentation for `django-admin.py`

## 1. Overview
**Purpose**:  
Legacy entry point for Django's command-line utility that has been deprecated. Provides backward compatibility while warning users to transition to the modern `django-admin` command.

**Location**:  
Typically found in virtual environment scripts directory (e.g., `venv/Scripts/` in Django projects). This file is auto-generated during Django installation in virtual environments.

---

## 2. Main Features / Responsibilities
- Issues deprecation warnings about `django-admin.py` usage
- Executes Django command-line interface (CLI) commands
- Forces migration to `django-admin` by preventing execution in Django 4.0+

## 3. Classes

## 4. Functions

### `execute_from_command_line()` (Indirect Call)
**Input**: Command-line arguments (via `sys.argv`)  
**Output**: System exit code (0 = success, 1 = error)  
**Usage**:  
Called automatically when script runs. Delegates to Django's core command-line processor.  
**Special Logic**:  
- Only triggered if script is executed as `__main__`
- Preceded by deprecation warning

---

## 5. Code Examples
```bash
# Deprecated usage (triggers warning):
./django-admin.py runserver

# Modern equivalent:
django-admin runserver
```

---

## 6. Design Decisions
1. **Deprecation Path**:  
   - Explicit warning before command execution ensures visibility
   - Hard failure in Django 4.0+ via removed dependency forces migration

2. **Backward Compatibility**:  
   Maintains functionality for older projects during 3.x upgrade period

3. **Virtual Environment Scope**:  
   File is auto-created in venvs rather than project codebase for cleaner upgrades

---

## 7. Dependencies
| Dependency | Usage |
|------------|-------|
| `django.core.management` | Core CLI execution via `execute_from_command_line()` |
| `django.utils.deprecation.RemovedInDjango40Warning` | Version-specific deprecation warning mechanism |

---

## 8. Best Practices & Warnings
‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical**:  
- **DELETE THIS FILE** in Django 4.0+ environments - it will break
- Never commit this file to version control (auto-generated in venvs)

‚úÖ **Recommendations**:  
1. Use `django-admin` directly for all new development
2. Update CI/CD pipelines and documentation references
3. Check for lingering `django-admin.py` references during upgrades

üõ† **Modification Guidance**:  
- Only edit to update deprecation messaging
- Never add new functionality - use Django's extension system instead
